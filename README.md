# Image classification with keras
image classification with keras in two approaches of sequential and functional API is implemented.

The sequential API allows us to create models layer by layer. The functional API in Keras is an alternate way of creating models that offer a lot more flexibility, including creating more complex models like RNNS. By using functional API model, we can have multiple models by changing the input and output of layers.<br/>
Here we will train Mnist dataset by these two approaches.
* Comments inside code explain the process of introducing layers in these two approaches.</br>
* For more explanation, you can use link[https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/] for functional API approach and link[https://keras.io/models/sequential/] for sequential approach.<br/>
