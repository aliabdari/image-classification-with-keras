# Image classification with keras
image classification with keras in two approach of sequential and functional API are implemented.

The sequential API allows us to create models layer by layer. The functional API in Keras is an alternate way of creating models that offers a lot more flexibility, including creating more complex models like RNNS.

here we will train Mnist dataset by this two approach
